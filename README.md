# Banchelor Studies Final Project

During the last year of Telecommunication Engineering Studies it was required to create a final year project. 
<p align="justify"> 
For my project I chose to create a device which could approximately of tell if an object is closer or farther from mobile phone.
Device communication with mobile phone is done using Bluetooth Low Energy technology. For control options it was required to create
an app which is called - ADVSP. In English it translates something like Personal Belongings Tracking Device App. Mobile application is compatible with Android 7.0+ </p>

Completed functions: 
* Battery level indication
* Out-of-bounds statistics
* User distance calculation formula calibration option
* Sound alarm on/off switching
* Device name selection
* Mobile phone vibration when device is reached set distance
